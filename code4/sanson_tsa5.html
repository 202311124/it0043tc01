                <p>Vyke was a Tarnished champion better known for being the closest to becoming Elden Lord before the arrival of the player protagonist.</p>
                <p>Vyke went on to the Roundtable Hold, where he got the title of Roundtable Knight. At a similar time he met Lansseax, and became her most loved knight. She shared with him Ancient Dragon incantations, many of which Vyke mastered to the point he got one named after him called Vyke's Dragonbolt, a signature move that electrified his body and lance, and which probably is the origin of the nickname Vyke the Dragonspear.</p>

                <p>Alexander is a living jar who travels the Lands Between, honing his strength in order to become a great warrior. Alexander was created to be a warrior vessel, and the remains of many great warriors reside within him. He originally came from Jarburg, a hidden village of living jars in Liurnia of the Lakes, however he vowed never to return, claiming that "the path of champions must be trod alone".</p>

                <p>Melina was born at the foot of the Erdtree and describes her mother as within the Erdtree. Although it is never stated, it can be inferred that her mother is Queen Marika the Eternal. During Boc's questline she asks if "being born of a mother" means acting in certain ways, which makes the specifics of her origins unclear.
                    At some point, Melina's body was burned, which left her bodiless and as a roaming spirit with no memory of her purpose given to her by her mother. And so, she looked for a way to go to the foot of the Erdtree to ascertain her given purpose, and to be able to govern her movement, seemingly lost as a spirit, meeting and travelling with Torrent at some time.</p>

                <p>Margit is an Omen who gained notoriety during The Shattering, in which he slaughtered countless champions who harbored ambitions for Lordship, stacking high their corpses during the Second Defense of Leyndell.
                    He is encountered by the Tarnished at the gates of Stormveil Castle, where he makes clear his disdain towards the Tarnished, and attempts to put an end to their quest for Lordship. Although he is defeated, Margit's voice is heard as he disappears.</p>

At the Academy of Raya Lucaria, he studied meteors, which formed the basis of the Olivinus Conspectus. He also glimpsed into the primeval current, witnessing the final moments of a great star cluster, the sight of which broke him.</p>
